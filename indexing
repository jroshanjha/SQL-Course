-- üß† What is an Index in MySQL?
An index improves query performance by allowing faster lookups 
on one or more columns. 
It is  like a book index ‚Äî find the page faster!

-- üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax
use sql_course;

select * from employees;

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);

describe employees;

select * from employees;

-- üîç How to Check Indexes
SHOW INDEX FROM employees;

select * from employees where salary = 0
MySQL will now use the index on salary (if suitable) to optimize performance.

-- üßπ To Drop an Index
drop index idx_salary ON employees;

SHOW INDEX FROM employees;


‚ùó When NOT to Use Indexes
On very small tables (performance gain is negligible)

On columns with high duplication (e.g., gender, status)

If you're doing lots of INSERT/UPDATE, indexes slow down writes




In database design, a composite key is a candidate key that consists of two or more attributes, 
(table columns) that together uniquely identify an entity occurrence (table row). 
A compound key is a composite key for which each attribute that makes up the key is a foreign key in its own right.
