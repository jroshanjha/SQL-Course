-- üß† What is an Index in MySQL?
An index improves query performance by allowing faster lookups 
on one or more columns. 
It is  like a book index ‚Äî find the page faster!

-- üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax
use sql_course;

select * from employees;

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);

CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(salary);

describe employees;

select * from employees;

-- üîç How to Check Indexes
SHOW INDEX FROM employees;

select * from employees where salary = 0
MySQL will now use the index on salary (if suitable) to optimize performance.

-- üßπ To Drop an Index
drop index idx_salary ON employees;

SHOW INDEX FROM employees;


‚ùó When NOT to Use Indexes
On very small tables (performance gain is negligible)

On columns with high duplication (e.g., gender, status)

If you're doing lots of INSERT/UPDATE, indexes slow down writes
