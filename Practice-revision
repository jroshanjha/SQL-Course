In MySQL, IS and IS NOT are used to compare NULL values 
because = and != do not work with NULL.
!= , <>

-- write a query for find unique purchase address
-- Reatrive sales data for product Wired Headphones and iPhone 
-- Fetch the sales data for order data between 2019-01 and 2019-03

Select distinct `Purchase address` from sales_data

select * from sales_data where product ='Wired Headphones' 
and product ='iPhone' 


select * from sales_data where `order date` 
between '2019-01-01' and '2019-03-31'

Select * from sales_data where `order date` 
between '2019-01' and '2019-03'

# Is is not recommendations
Select * from sales_data where `order date` 
between '2019' and '2019'

# this is correct -> fetch records between of them
Select * from sales_data where `order date` 
between '2019' and '2020'

-- Note *** 

✅ IS and IS NOT in MySQL
In MySQL, IS and IS NOT are used to compare NULL values because = and != do not work with NULL.

🔹 IS NULL and IS NOT NULL
📌 Check for NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;

📌 Check for NOT NULL values
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NOT NULL;

🔹 Why Not Use = for NULL?
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = NULL;  -- ❌ Wrong

✅ Always use IS NULL instead of = NULL because NULL is not comparable using =.


🔹 IS TRUE, IS FALSE, IS UNKNOWN
📌 Example: Using IS TRUE

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE payment_completed IS TRUE;

✅ Finds orders where payment_completed = 1.
📌 Example: Using IS FALSE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE payment_completed IS FALSE;


✅ Finds orders where payment_completed = 0.
📌 Example: Using IS UNKNOWN (For NULL Values)

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE discount IS UNKNOWN;
✅ Same as IS NULL, checks if discount is NULL.


🚀 Summary
✅ Use IS NULL / IS NOT NULL instead of = NULL
✅ Use IS TRUE / IS FALSE for boolean values
✅ Avoid using = and != with NULL
