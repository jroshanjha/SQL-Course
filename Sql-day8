Permanently Disable Safe Update Mode (Not Recommended)
If you want to permanently disable safe update mode in MySQL, you can do so by modifying your MySQL client settings. For example, in MySQL Workbench:
Go to Edit > Preferences > SQL Editor.
Uncheck the option Safe Updates (rejects UPDATEs and DELETEs with no restrictions).
Reconnect to the database.
