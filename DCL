Data Control Language (DCL)

-- 1. Data Control Language (DCL) is used to control access 
-- and manage user permissions within a database. 

-- DCL stands for Data Control Language, which is a subset of 
SQL (Structured Query Language) used to control access to data in a database. 

-- 2. It ensures data security and determines who can perform operations 
-- like data manipulation and retrieval.

-- 3. DCL commands manage user permissions and security by granting or revoking privileges on database objects.

-- 4. GRANT: Assigns specific privileges (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to users or roles.
-- 5. REVOKE: Removes previously granted privileges from users or roles.
-- 6. DCL ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data.
